614397597,CN118314932A,"The present disclosure relates to power management and delivery for high bandwidth memory. The high bandwidth memory HBM device can include a power management integrated circuit PMIC, a voltage regulator integrated within an interface die of the HBM system or included as a separate chip within a HBM system stack. Thus, the HBM system can be supplied with a higher voltage and the voltage can be adjusted to a desired power level, which can increase the total power available to the HBM system without increasing the number of microbumps. In addition, a ground voltage, a positive voltage, or both, can be supplied to the HBM device via its back interface, which can reduce the number of microbumps at the front interface. In some examples, a modified heat sink assembly is capable of supplying the ground voltage, the positive voltage, or both to the HBM system."

The method comprises: initializing i to a1and j to a2; if HBM sampling fails when the delay is i, i=i+Δa, repeating the segment judgment until success, and assigning the current value of i to i0; if HBM sampling is successful when the delay is i0+Δa, i0+2×Δa, and i0+3×Δa, then judging whether HBM sampling is successful when the delay is set to j; if failure, j=j‑Δa, repeating the judgment until success, and assigning the current value of j to j0; if HBM sampling is successful when the delay is j0‑Δa, j0‑2×Δa, and j0‑3×Δa, then judging whether HBM sampling is successful when the delay is (i0+j0)/2, and if success, determining (i0+j0)/2 as the optimal delay.

Certain data patterns, including a long series of logic zero values or a long series of logic one values, can cause asymmetric degradation of the transistors contained in the delay elements. This asymmetric degradation reduces the operating frequency of the memory device, resulting in reduced performance. The disclosed embodiments change the polarity of the signal passing through the delay elements to mitigate the effects of asymmetric degradation caused by these data patterns. Accordingly, the performance of the memory device is improved relative to existing methods."

593012219,US11936379B2,"Embodiments include a memory device with an improved calibration circuit. Memory device input/output pins include delay lines for adjusting the delay in each memory input/output signal path. The delay adjustment circuitry includes digital delay lines for adjusting this delay. Further, each digital delay line is calibrated via a digital delay line locked loop which enables adjustment of the delay through the digital delay line in fractions of a unit interval across variations due to differences in manufacturing process, operating voltage, and operating temperature. The disclosed techniques calibrate the digital delay lines by measuring both the high phase and the low phase of the clock signal. As a result, the disclosed techniques compensate for duty cycle distortion by combining the calibration results from both phases of the clock signal. The disclosed techniques thereby result in lower calibration error relative to approaches that measure only one phase of the clock signal."

The gradient structure further comprises a film of the adhesion species on an outer surface of the at least one sidewall. A dielectric material is implanted into the film of the adhesion species to form a sidewall liner.

The activation of one diverter and one driver selects one word line. The method involves utilizing a diverter that couples a bias current to the common coupled ends of the word lines of each group through the clamp diode which bias current is slightly larger than the driver selection current through the selection diode. When driver selection current is coupled through the selection diode a portion of the common mode bias current, equal to the selection current, is diverted to the activated driver''s common mode node return path limiting the selected word line voltage excursion to the clamp diode''s voltage drop. This small voltage swing of the selected word line, being limited to the clamp diode drop, during the selection sequence generates substantially reduced capacitive and inductive coupled noise signals in the readout bit lines, and, accordingly, substantially improves the signal-to-noise ratio."
